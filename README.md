# Getting Started at the ATR Lab
<b>Code of conduct, rules and dynamics of the laboratory</b>

<hr>

The ATR Guidelines and Code of Conduct are one of the ways we aim to put the ATR Lab's values into practice.   
With a mission to innovate beyond the standards of traditional academic research, we write these recognizing that our work at the ATR Lab will have an impact outside of our doors and our conduct should reflect ethical conduct.
